# Wimbledon 2024 Final: Novak Djokovic vs Carlos Alcaraz - what to expect, head-to-head record, where to watch & more
The Wimbledon 2024 men's singles final between Carlos Alcaraz and Novak Djokovic is scheduled to be held on Sunday, July 14, at 6:30 PM IST at Centre Court, located at the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club in London.
The world No. 2 Novak Djokovic will face the reigning champion and world No. 3 Carlos Alcaraz in the Wimbledon 2024 men's singles championship today.

As he approaches significant Grand Slam and tournament records, Djokovic will try to alter tennis history in a match that will be a rematch of the 2023 final. With an eighth victory, the Serbian could tie Swiss great Roger Federer for the most men's singles championships at Wimbledon. This would make Djokovic the first player to win 25 Grand Slams as well.

Up until last year, when Alcaraz defeated him in the championship match, Djokovic had won four straight titles at the All England Club. The Spaniard was behind 1-6 in the opening set but won 7–6(8–6) and 6–1. Following Djokovic's victory in the fourth set, Alcaraz defeated the seven-time champion 6–4 in the pivotal fifth set.

Head-to-head stats:

In their head-to-head match, Djokovic leads Alcaraz 3-2. The Serb did take his Wimbledon revenge, winning the final two encounters of the previous year back-to-back.

What to expect from the final match?

As he often does when he hits the court, Novak Djokovic should be prepared to play with a great deal of stakes in the next final between Carlos Alcaraz and himself. The 24-time Grand Slam champion faces the same records as before last year's Wimbledon final versus Alcaraz. But he probably won't be thinking much about these numbers during this eagerly awaited rematch.

Djokovic has established a reputation for pulling off comebacks throughout his remarkable career, whether it be against Federer, Nadal, or Medvedev in the US Open final last year. Undoubtedly, Alcaraz will be ready for Djokovic's great ability to equalise the score today.

The Spaniard would want to minimise the possibility of getting off to a sluggish start. In the previous year's final, as well as in the previous two matches against Tommy Paul and Medvedev, he may have bounced back from a similar situation. That would be the very last thing he would want to happen to a revenge-seeking Djokovic, though.
